# Move Subtitles

A Minecraft mod that allows you to move the subtitles to any place on the screen.

## Installation

This mod has been written for Minecraft >= 1.20.4

Get packaged versions from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/move-subtitles) or [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/move-subtitles)!

## Configuration

The configuration file (created on first launch) contains an "edge" key that can be set to any of `TOP_LEFT`, `TOP`, `TOP_RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `BOTTOM_LEFT`, `BOTTOM`, `BOTTOM_RIGHT`.
You may use the `deltaX` and `deltaY` values to manually tweak positioning relative to the configured edge position.

## Mod Compatibility

This should be compatible with any other mod. I recommend Toggle Subtitles and Colourful Subtitles.
